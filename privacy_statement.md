# Privacy Statement

The protection of your privacy while using Scrum Poker as well as the security of all business data collected, processed and used by Scrum Poker is an important concern to us.

In this document we provide details on how we secure your data. If you find something missing or you have any security related questions please feel free to contact us at stefan.glase@googlemail.com.

## Collection, processing and usage of personal data

We only store the minimal amount of data required to provide our service. We do not store issue details, task descriptions, comments nor other sensitive information. We never store users full names nor e-mails but we use user keys provided by Jira which can contain them.

The following data is collected and persisted into the Jira database during a Scrum Poker session:

* user keys - associate all votes and the session starter with a Jira user
* issue key - associate the session with a Jira issue
* estimation votes - show the bandwidth of votes of all participants
* visibility of cards - reveal the votes or hide them depending on the status of the session
* confirmed vote - estimation that has been confirmed at the end of a Scrum Poker session

All data and information is solely used for the execution of Scrum Poker sessions.

The session data is kept visible for 12 hours in the list of recently finished sessions. After that the votes are solely used to display reference issues to users for currently running sessions. 

## Log files

As we continuously strive to provide you with improvements and fixes for bugs Scrum Poker writes log files in case of an error occurring inside Scrum Poker.

The information collected helps us to fix bugs as soon as they appear so that their negative impact on our customers is smaller.

What do we collect?

* error details - time, error message and stacktrace
* information about Scrum Poker - version
* information about Jira - version 

We do explicitly not collect any information about your issues nor any user details.

## Cookie usage

Scrum Poker uses and creates no cookies by itself. As Scrum Poker runs as a plugin inside Jira there may be cookies created by Jira but Scrum Poker does not read those cookies.

## Web analytics

Scrum Poker does not use any Web analytics platform to track the usage of the Scrum Poker plugin. As Scrum Poker runs as a plugin inside Jira there might be such tools gathering usage data on application level.

## External links

Scrum Poker does not provide any external links apart from links to the website of Scrum Poker itself on the configuration and plugin administration page.
