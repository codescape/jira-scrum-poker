# Quick Reload Config File
# ------------------------------
#
# Add directories to this file, one on each line, and the quick reload support will monitor them
# and automatically load them as soon as they are compiled and assembled.
#
# Directories can be relative to this configuration file and hence allow directories outside
# your project to be monitored and reloaded.#
# You can use -Dquickreload.dirs=dir1,dir2,dir3 on the JVM command line to also specify directories
# to monitor.
