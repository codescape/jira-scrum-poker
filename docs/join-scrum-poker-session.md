### Preconditions

A Scrum Poker session can only be joined by users who may see the issue for that the Scrum Poker session is started.


### Choose your preferred way

To join a currently running Scrum Poker session there are basically three ways in doing so.

#### Find your session in the Active Sessions list

The preferred and easiest way is the so called `Active Sessions` page which can be accessed from the main navigation menu `Boards` provided by Jira Software where you can find another `Active Sessions` link.

This page can also be accessed from the `Scrum Poker` dropdown that is visible on every agile board in Jira. This dropdown might not be shown depending on the `Show Dropdown on Boards` setting as explained on the [Configuration](/configuration) page.

The `Active Session` page displays all currently running and recently finished sessions related to issues that are visible to you.
It allows you to directly jump into all running sessions.

#### Start the session from the Issue detail page

As an alternative you can use all the ways described on the page showing how to [Start a Scrum Poker session](/start-scrum-poker-session), too.
The button is not labelled `Start Scrum Poker` when an active session exists but displays as `Join Scrum Poker` in this case.

#### Join a session through scanning QR code from the session page

If your team is in the same room and wants to use mobile devices to join a Scrum Poker session they can scan the provided QR code available from the `Share Session` dropdown on the session page for example visible to all participants on a monitor or projector.
